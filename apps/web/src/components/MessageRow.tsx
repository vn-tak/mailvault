/**
 * One message row, used by the inbox and by the dashboard's recent list. It lives in one
 * file because the dashboard once kept its own copy of the markup and fell out of step
 * with the grid the stylesheet expects — which showed up as a page wider than a phone.
 *
 * The row is one line wide on a desktop and two on a phone, and it carries only what tells
 * mail apart: who, what it says, when, and the few marks that change what opening it means.
 * Everything descriptive about *how* it arrived — the alias it landed on, the verdict's
 * wording, the domain — belongs to the message, because a list of 20 rows repeating
 * `demo.example` twenty times is not information, it is noise with a headcount.
