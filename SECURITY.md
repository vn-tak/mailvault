# MailVault Security Model

This document maps the security requirements for a private, internet-facing
receive-only mail system onto the actual implementation, and states the threat model.
Email is treated as **hostile input at every layer**.

Scope: personal/self-hosted use by a single owner behind Cloudflare Access. Not
multi-tenant SaaS.

---

## 1. Trust boundaries

```
Internet ──SMTP──▶ Cloudflare Email Routing ──▶ Worker.email()   [untrusted input]
Browser ──HTTPS──▶ Cloudflare Access ──JWT──▶ Worker.fetch()      [authenticated]
                     Worker ──token(secret)──▶ Cloudflare API     [privileged egress]
                     Worker ◀──▶ D1 / R2                          [private storage]
```

The owner's browser is untrusted for CSRF; the sender of any email is entirely
untrusted; the Cloudflare API token is the single most sensitive secret.

---

## 2. Secrets & the Cloudflare API token

**Rule:** the runtime token exists *only* as a Worker secret.

- Typed as a secret binding in `apps/worker/src/env.ts`
  (`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN?: string`). Set with `wrangler secret put` (prod) or
  `.dev.vars` (local). Never a plain-text `vars` value.
- The Cloudflare client is constructed per-request from `env` in
  `apps/worker/src/routes/_helpers.ts` → `cfClient(env)`. If unset it throws a
  `503 CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN_UNSET` and **never** echoes the value.
- The token is never placed in a response body, D1 row, R2 object, or the browser.
- Least-privilege: the token only needs *Email Routing* + *Zone/DNS read+edit* on the
  owner's zones. A Global API Key is **not** supported or required.
- Log scrubbing: `apps/worker/src/lib/logging.ts` allow-lists safe fields and
  redacts a set of keys (`token`, `authorization`, `cf_authorization`, `api_key`,
  `cloudflare_api_token`, `raw`, `body`, `otp`, `code`, `jwt`, `cookie`) to
  `[redacted]`. Error messages are truncated and never include request headers.

**Why it matters:** a leaked token would let an attacker mutate DNS/mail for every
domain in the account — the blast radius is the whole account, so it is isolated as a
secret and scrubbed from every log path.

## 3. Authentication (private by default)

`apps/worker/src/auth.ts`:

- Identity comes from a Cloudflare **Access** application JWT, validated with `jose`
  against the team's remote JWKS: signature, issuer (`team domain`), audience
  (`CF_ACCESS_AUD`) and expiry are all verified. Preferred source is the
  `cf-access-jwt-assertion` header, falling back to the `CF_Authorization` cookie.
- An optional `ALLOWED_EMAILS` allowlist further restricts which Access users are
  honored; an empty list means "any authenticated Access user".
- Service tokens (no `email` claim) are rejected.
- The only **public** endpoint is `GET /api/health` (coarse liveness). Everything
  under `/api/*` is authenticated in `apps/worker/src/app.ts` before routing;
  unauthorized requests get `401 UNAUTHORIZED`. No stack traces leak (Hono `onError`
  returns a structured `{ error: { code, message } }`).

### Dev bypass cannot reach production
`apps/worker/src/env.ts` → `devAuthBypassEnabled()` returns true **only** when
`DEV_AUTH_BYPASS=="true"` **and** `ENVIRONMENT` is one of `development/local/test`.
Production config ships `ENVIRONMENT=production`, so the bypass is inert regardless of
the flag — accidental exposure is structurally impossible.

### Passkey step-up (`apps/worker/src/routes/security.ts`, `src/lib/webauthn.ts`)

Access answers *which account* signed in. A step-up answers *is the same person holding
this device right now*, so a copied session cookie cannot do the irreversible things on its
own. It is asked for, by the route rather than the page, before:

- purging an alias's stored mail (`DELETE /api/aliases/:id` with `purgeMessages`) — a plain
  alias delete, which keeps the mail, does not ask;
- detaching a domain from MailVault;
- setting a domain's sender-auth policy to `OFF` (tightening it never asks);
- enrolling an additional passkey once one exists — otherwise a hijacked session could
  quietly add the attacker's key and the gate would be theirs.

How it works: the browser's authenticator signs a single-use challenge (60s), and the
Worker returns a bearer grant valid for 5 minutes. Only its SHA-256 is stored, so reading
D1 cannot mint someone else's unlock; the grant lives in memory in the tab and is gone on
reload. `userVerification: required`, so the prompt must be a fingerprint, passcode or
security key rather than mere presence.

Boundaries worth stating: the relying-party id is the canonical `APP_ORIGIN` host, so a
passkey enrolled on `mail.tungjp.store` will not unlock the transitional
`mail.omnipos.tech` hostname. And removing the **last** passkey needs only the signed-in
identity — that is the break-glass path, because a lost key must not mean a lost account.
The residual risk is unchanged by this feature: whoever holds your Access session can still
read everything. Step-up protects what cannot be undone, not confidentiality.

## 4. CSRF & same-origin

`apps/worker/src/security/headers.ts` → `checkCsrf()`, wired as middleware after auth:

- State-changing methods (anything but GET/HEAD/OPTIONS) must carry the custom header
  `x-mailvault: 1`. A cross-site form cannot set custom headers.
- `Origin` (or `Referer`) host must equal the request host **or** the configured
  `APP_ORIGIN`. This is why E2E/dev run same-origin.
- Failures return `403 BAD_ORIGIN`.

## 5. Response hardening (every response)

`decorateResponse()` in `index.ts` wraps **both** the API and the static-asset path,
so success, error, 404 and SPA-document responses all get:

- `Content-Security-Policy`: `default-src 'self'`; `script-src 'self'`;
  `frame-ancestors 'none'`; `form-action 'none'`; `object-src 'none'`;
  `base-uri 'none'`; `connect-src 'self'`; `img-src 'self' data: blob:`;
  `frame-src 'self' blob: data:` (for the sandboxed email frame).
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`,
  `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy/Opener-Policy: same-origin`,
  `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`, a restrictive
  `Permissions-Policy`.
- `Strict-Transport-Security` on API responses in production.

## 6. Email content handling (hostile input)

Parsing: `apps/worker/src/mail/parse.ts` uses `postal-mime`; the raw `.eml` is always
kept in R2 so nothing is lost even on degraded parses (`parseDegraded`).

Sanitization: `apps/worker/src/security/sanitize-html.ts` (`sanitizeEmailHtml`):

- Drops `<script>`, `<style>`, `<iframe>/<object>/<embed>/<form>` and similar **together
  with their contents** — the element's text is discarded, not escaped, so a stripped
  script cannot leave its source visible in the message. Unknown tags are removed while
  their inner text is HTML-escaped, so leftover text can never execute.
- `javascript:`/`data:`/`vbscript:` and other unsafe URLs are stripped from `href`.
- Remote images are **blocked by default**; they render only when the owner opts in
  per-message (`?remoteImages=1`), because loading them discloses the reader's IP and
  that the mail was opened.
- Surviving links get `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.

Rendering: the SPA's `MessageHtml.tsx` injects the sanitized HTML into an
`iframe` with `sandbox=""` (no scripts, no same-origin, no forms) loaded from a
Blob URL with its own `<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy">` and
`<base target="_blank">`. Email markup is never added to the top-level document.
The frame document also gets a `<meta viewport>` and a rule neutralising
`width="…"` on tables and cells: mail layout is built from fixed-width tables, and
without that a 700px mail overflows a 360px phone frame and has to be panned.

Plain text is rendered by `TextBody.tsx`, never as markup: blocks are split on blank
lines, indented blocks (ASCII tables, signatures) stay verbatim in a box that scrolls by
itself, and other lines are re-flowed with the mailer's incidental hard breaks removed.
Bare `http(s)` addresses become links with `rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"`; nothing
else in the body is ever interpreted as HTML.

## 6.1 Verification links (`apps/worker/src/mail/links.ts`)

The owner is being asked to hand a token to whatever they tap, so extraction is
conservative and the UI shows the whole address:

- **Folded addresses are re-joined** only when the fragment stops at a character that
  cannot end a URL, or the continuation carries query syntax. Guessing on mid-word breaks
  would glue the next prose line onto a complete address — a visibly truncated link is
  safer than a silently wrong one.
- **Click-through wrappers are unwrapped** (`/CL0/https:%2F%2F…`, `?url=…`). The address as
  sent stays the link that is opened, while `destination` records where it leads; the card
  names the destination host and says it arrived behind a tracking host, and offers
  "Open as sent" separately.
- A wrapped link and its direct twin **collapse into one entry**.
- Entities (`&amp;`, `&#38;`) are decoded before use, and sentence punctuation is trimmed
  with balanced-bracket awareness, so `…/compare(a,b)` keeps its `)` and `…/verify.` loses
  its period.
- Nothing is ever fetched or preflighted server-side; a link opens only on an explicit
  click.

## 6.2 Sender authentication (`apps/worker/src/mail/auth.ts`)

An OTP inbox is a phishing target: the whole product is "show the owner a code and a
verification link". Anyone who learns an alias address can therefore try to deliver a
message that *looks* like it came from a brand, so every message is judged at delivery
time and the judgement is stored (`messages.auth_verdict` + `auth_json`).

- **`Authentication-Results` is not trusted as written.** It travels inside the message, so
  the sender can author `dkim=pass` themselves. A pass only counts when the domain it
  vouches for (`d=`, `header.d=`, `header.i=`, `smtp.mailfrom=`) **aligns** with the header
  `From` domain at registrable-domain level — DMARC's own rule. Misaligned passes are
  recorded as evidence and reported honestly (`spf=pass`) but never credited
  (`alignedPass.dkim === false`), and the UI labels exactly that distinction.
- **Verdicts:** `SPOOFED` when `dmarc=fail` (the one result the header cannot fake into
  usefulness); `TRUSTED` when an aligned `dmarc`/`dkim`/`spf` pass exists; `UNVERIFIED`
  otherwise — including when no results reached us at all, which is honest rather than
  alarming.
- **Enforcement is per domain, default `WARN`:** `OFF` records only, `WARN` records and
  flags, `REJECT` refuses delivery (`setReject("sender authentication failed")`) — chosen
  by the owner per domain in the Domains table, never flipped silently.
- **The payload of a spoofed message is withheld, not just labelled.** `MessageDetail`
  hides extracted codes and verification links behind an explicit "Show anyway", and the
  inbox list never echoes a `primaryCode` for a `SPOOFED` message.
- **Old mail is not re-judged with guesses.** Rows written before this existed carry
  `UNVERIFIED` with no assessment JSON, and the banner stays silent for them.

### 6.3 Ingest durability — `apps/worker/src/index.ts` (`email` + `queue`)

Inbound mail is committed in two invocations so a database hiccup cannot lose a message:

- The **email handler** validates the recipient, parses, judges the sender and writes the
  R2 objects (raw `.eml`, parsed JSON, attachments). Only then does it post an `IngestJob`
  to the `mail-ingest` queue. Every `setReject()` decision — unknown recipient, oversize,
  `REJECT` policy on a spoofed sender — still happens here, because this is the only place
  still able to answer the sending server.
- The **queue consumer** commits the D1 row and the FTS entry, then fires push. A failed
  commit is retried (3 attempts) and then parked in `mail-ingest-dlq`. Nothing is deleted
  on failure: the staged objects stay exactly where they are, so a redelivery works on the
  same bytes, and a dead-lettered job still points at a retrievable `.eml`.

**The queue carries keys and SMTP addressing only** — `rawKey`, `parsedKey`, alias/domain
ids, dedupe key, envelope. No subject, body, extracted code or link crosses it, verified by
test. That matters because a queue and its dead-letter are a second store the owner does
not browse; they must not quietly become an unauthenticated copy of somebody's mail. R2
remains the only place message content lives.

Codes, links, preview and the auth verdict are *re-derived* at commit time from the staged
parse by the same pure functions — one assessment per message, and the stored verdict
cannot disagree with the one that was judged at the edge.

### 6.4 Live updates — `apps/worker/src/live/hub.ts`, `apps/web/src/lib/live.ts`

`GET /api/live` upgrades to a Durable Object websocket so an open tab learns that mail
landed without waiting for a pull-to-refresh.

- The frame the hub ever sends is `{"type":"hello"}` or `{"type":"new-mail"}`. **No sender,
  subject, code or link crosses the socket.** The tab reacts by refetching through
  `/api/*`, which is where access control actually lives, so the socket inherits it rather
  than bypassing it.
- The route sits behind the same Access verification as every other `/api/*` handler, and
  the hub instance is keyed by the authenticated address, so a second identity on the team
  cannot even observe that the owner's mail arrived.
- The client ignores any frame that is not the nudge and never renders socket data.
- `connect-src 'self'` covers the same-origin `wss://` handshake — verified live, not
  assumed, and covered by an E2E test that completes a real handshake and waits for the
  first frame.

## 7. Attachments

`apps/worker/src/routes/messages.ts` (download route) + `apps/worker/src/lib/filename.ts`:

- Attachment bytes live in the **private** R2 bucket; there are no public URLs and no
  permanent links. The only access path is the authenticated
  `GET /api/messages/:mid/attachments/:aid`, which verifies the message belongs to the
  caller's data before streaming.
- Download responses force `Content-Disposition: attachment` with a sanitized
  filename (directories, control chars, path traversal and a restrictive charset are
  stripped; extension preserved), plus `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` and
  `Cache-Control: private, no-store`. Dangerous types are never inlined.

## 8. Alias safety — refuse unknown mail

`apps/worker/src/mail/ingest.ts`:

- Inbound acceptance is gated on an **ACTIVE alias row** in D1 matched by normalized
  recipient address. Unknown recipients are **rejected** (`message.setReject`) and are
  **never auto-created** — so the domain cannot be turned into a spam sink by
  guessing addresses. Mail to a `DISABLED` alias is rejected too (history preserved).
- Delivery is idempotent via a UNIQUE `dedupe_key`, so Cloudflare retries after a
  persistence throw cannot duplicate messages.
- Messages over `MAX_MESSAGE_BYTES` are rejected; the configured ceiling is clamped to
  Cloudflare's ~25 MiB inbound limit (`env.ts`).

## 8.1 Notifications (Web Push) — `apps/worker/src/push.ts`, `apps/web/public/sw.js`

- **The push carries no content; the worker asks for it afterwards.** The server sends a
  bodyless POST, so the push service sees an empty request (`test/unit/push.test.ts` asserts
  that). The service worker then calls `/api/messages?filter=unread` with its own session
  cookies and quotes the newest message that is unread, `TRUSTED` (aligned SPF/DKIM/DMARC)
  and minutes old — sender plus subject only, with any code the server identified masked and
  URLs collapsed to `[link]`. Everything else (signed out, offline, Access answering instead
  of the API, nothing recent, a spoofed sender) falls back to the fixed "New mail arrived".
  `src/lib/notify.test.ts` covers those rules; the phone E2E runs them inside the installed
  worker, where the real cookies live.
- **What that costs, deliberately:** the subject of *trusted* mail now appears on the lock
  screen of every device holding the installation, without an Access prompt. Codes and
  unauthenticated senders are excluded exactly because a spoofed message choosing its own
  lock-screen text is the attack this product attracts. OS "hide content when locked" is the
  remaining lever.
- **A push endpoint is a bearer credential**, so it is stored only in D1, never returned by
  any API response, never logged, and never cached by the service worker. `/api/push/status`
  reports a count, not the endpoints; the integration test asserts the response body does not
  contain the stored URL.
- **Validation + self-healing.** Only HTTPS endpoints of bounded length are accepted
  (`isUsableEndpoint`), re-subscribing the same endpoint updates keys and clears the failure
  counter rather than duplicating rows, a `404/410` prunes immediately, and a repeated
  failure prunes after 5 attempts so dead endpoints cannot accumulate.
- **Push can never break delivery.** Notification is fired with `ctx.waitUntil` after the
  message is durable, and `pushToAll` never throws — an unreachable push provider cannot
  reject or duplicate a real email.
- **The VAPID private key is a Worker secret** (`VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY`, a P-256 JWK). The public
  half is derived from it, so the two can never disagree, and the derivation is checked
  against `crypto.subtle`'s own `raw` export.
- **A subscription is owner-supplied, and that is the whole trust model.** Only a signed-in
  owner can register an endpoint, so the Worker will POST a bodyless request to an HTTPS URL
  they chose. There is no payload to leak, the VAPID assertion is audience-scoped to that
  origin, and the response is never returned to a caller — so the reachability an attacker
  would want here is already limited to the owner's own account.
- The service worker never caches `/api/*` and never proxies a cross-origin request, so the
  offline shell cannot become an unaccessed copy of private mail.

## 9. Domain provisioning safety (the highest-risk feature)

`apps/worker/src/provisioning/` + `apps/worker/src/routes/domains.ts`:

- **Zero mutation on startup/deploy.** The Worker entrypoint never enables Email
  Routing, touches MX, replaces a catch-all, or provisions a zone. `sync` is read-only
  discovery.
- **Preflight is read-only** (`preflight.ts`) — proven by `test/unit/preflight.test.ts`
  asserting an empty mutation list. It classifies each zone and returns evidence.
- **Foreign MX is never overwritten *by default*** (`mx.ts`): Google Workspace, Microsoft 365,
  Zoho, Fastmail, Yahoo, Apple, Proton, Mimecast, Proofpoint, Barracuda, SpamTitan, IONOS,
  Amazon SES, Migadu and Yandex 360 signatures — and *any* non-Cloudflare host — mark
  `MX_CONFLICT` → `safeToProvision=false`, default **skip**. Only Cloudflare Email
  Routing MX counts as "ours". The IONOS/SES/Migadu/Yandex entries were added from
  hostnames actually observed in the owner's account.
- **An MX take-over exists, and it is the owner pulling the trigger** (`allowMxTakeover`):
  the Domains UI lists the exact records that will be deleted per selected domain, the
  confirm is a separate checkbox from the catch-all one (a catch-all confirmation buys no
  MX deletion — tested), and each record is written to `provisioning_events` *before* it is
  removed so the domain can be handed back. Matching requires `type === "MX"` plus an
  exchange the preflight named as foreign, so Cloudflare's own routing MX cannot be caught.
  Nothing but MX is touched: enabling routing does not add a second SPF, so deleting the
  provider's SPF/DKIM/DMARC would break the owner's outbound mail for no inbound gain
  (measured on a live take-over).
- **`DOMAIN_DENYLIST` (a Worker var) is checked before any mutation**, whatever the flags
  say. It exists for domains the owner runs another mail product on — they are refused with
  an explicit message rather than silently skipped, so the reason is visible in the UI.
- **Foreign catch-all** marks `CATCH_ALL_CONFLICT`; a takeover requires an explicit
  `allowCatchAllTakeover` confirmation from the owner (surfaced in the Domains UI).
- **Provisioning is allow-listed, not block-listed** (`provisioner.ts`). It mutates only
  when preflight returns `READY_TO_PROVISION`, `ALREADY_CONFIGURED`, or a conflict *with*
  the matching explicit confirmation from the owner (`CATCH_ALL_CONFLICT` →
  `allowCatchAllTakeover`, `MX_CONFLICT` → `allowMxTakeover`). Everything else —
  including a preflight read that Cloudflare refused — stops before any write. A token
  that cannot *see* a zone is therefore never able to *change* it. This replaced an
  earlier block-list that let an unrecognized classification fall through to mutation,
  found only by exercising the live API.
- **`cfCode 10000` is ambiguous, and provision must not guess.** Measured live: `POST
  /zones/{id}/email/routing/enable` returns the same 403 `Authentication error` for a zone
  outside the token's Zone Resources as it would for a missing permission — this is what
  first masqueraded as "an API token cannot enable Email Routing". It can, and now does:
  with the zone in scope a clean zone reached `READY` purely through the app. The endpoint
  that genuinely has no token permission is `GET /zones/{id}/email/routing` (the settings
  flag), which 403s in every scope and permission set tried. Consequences: routing state is
  derived from DNS instead of the unreadable flag (narrowly — other failures still
  propagate), the enable call is skipped when Cloudflare MX already exist, and a refused
  enable names both possible causes — the missing `Email Routing Rules: Edit` permission and
  the token's Zone Resources — and says whether this run already deleted the domain's MX.
  See `DEPLOYMENT.md`.
- **Drift is detected, never "repaired".** `provisioning/watchdog.ts` runs hourly
  (`triggers.crons`) and on demand from *Verify delivery*, re-reading the delivery path of
  domains MailVault believes work. If Cloudflare's routing MX disappeared or the catch-all
  was moved to another destination, the domain is marked `CONFLICT / DRIFT` with the new
  destination named — it **never** re-enables routing or rewrites the catch-all to win mail
  back, because someone else's configuration is not MailVault's to overwrite. It restores a
  domain to `READY` only if *it* was the one that marked it drifted (an MX-conflict domain
  is never resurrected because routing happens to look fine), and an unreadable zone is
  recorded as unknown rather than downgraded.
- **Zone Resources are account-wide on purpose.** The token scopes its zone permissions to
  `All zones from an account`, not a per-zone list, so adding a domain never requires
  editing the token. Widening a *resource* does not widen a *capability* — it only changes
  which zones the same four permissions apply to: `Zone:Read`, `DNS:Read` and
  `Email Routing Addresses:Read` are read-only, and the one write,
  `Email Routing Rules:Edit`, reaches the catch-all rule and (through the same permission)
  `email/routing/enable`. That is exactly the blast radius to reason about, and it is
  bounded in code, not by the token: mutation happens only behind the allow-list gate
  above, only for a zone the owner imported and selected (a zone absent from `domains` is
  refused before any API call — `test/unit/provisioner.test.ts`), only via an
  authenticated owner-triggered route, and never for foreign MX. Measured on the owner's
  account: sync + preflight classified 38/38 zones and reported 35 conflicts with zero
  writes; one clean zone was then enabled deliberately, by the owner, in one click.
- **No unused write permissions.** `DNS:Edit` was granted during diagnosis, shown by
  measurement to unlock nothing required, and reverted to `DNS:Read`.
- **Removing a domain** deletes only the local row; the code refuses while aliases
  exist and **never** deletes the Cloudflare zone or its DNS.
- Every Cloudflare-side operation is wrapped so API/permission/rate-limit errors map
  to safe `asApiError` codes without leaking the token. Diagnostics log only the API
  path, status and Cloudflare error code — never headers, bodies or the token.

## 10. Data retention — nothing auto-expires
`migrations/0001_init.sql` and the app have **no** TTL, cron, lifecycle rule, or
background job that deletes mailbox content. Aliases and messages persist until the
owner explicitly deletes them, and message deletion only purges content when asked.
The one scheduled job that exists (`7 * * * *`) is the read-only drift watchdog in §9;
it writes status columns and never touches a message, an alias or a zone.

**Rules inherit this limit.** `packages/shared/src/rules.ts` accepts only `archive` and
`tag` as actions — there is no delete verb for a rule to reach — and filing sets
`messages.archived = 1`, which moves mail out of the working list and nothing else. The
`Filed` tab and `archived=all` still return it. A rule records how it was worded at the
moment it acted (`applied_rule_note`), so an archive from last month is explainable after
the rule is edited or removed, and rule evaluation runs *after* the message row is
committed, wrapped so a broken rule can never cost the owner mail that arrived.

## 11. Input validation

`packages/shared` Zod schemas validate every request body/query (`readJson`,
`parseQuery`) with tight bounds: local-part charset/length + reserved names, label
length, pagination limits (≤200), filter enums, etc. Validation failures return
`400 VALIDATION_ERROR` rather than reaching the DB.

- **Search syntax is data, not a query.** Values are always bound as parameters, but an
  FTS5 `MATCH` string is parsed by the index itself, so `"`, `AND`, `NOT`, `col:` and
  syntax errors in it are a caller-controlled grammar. `ftsMatch()` reduces the input to
  quoted word tokens (capped at 8) and the search falls back to LIKE-only when nothing
  usable remains, so a hostile query returns zero rows instead of a `500`. Proven by
  `test/integration/ingest.test.ts` ("FTS5 syntax attacks").

## 12. What is deliberately out of scope in V1

- Sending mail (receive-only).
- Multi-user tenancy and per-user authorization (single owner behind Access).
- DKIM signing / outbound reputation (no sending).
- Automatic conflict resolution (always human-confirmed).

## 13. Residual risks / operator responsibilities

- **Access configuration.** The owner must put the Worker behind a real Cloudflare
  Access application with a strong policy and keep `CF_ACCESS_AUD`/team domain
  correct; without it, only `DEV_AUTH_BYPASS=false` prevents open access.
- **Token scope.** Grant the narrowest token possible; rotate periodically.
- **OTP/verification links** are sensitive; treat the inbox like a password manager.
- **E2E suite** runs against a local `wrangler dev` Worker with `DEV_AUTH_BYPASS=true`
  in `ENVIRONMENT=development`. That config must never be deployed; the production
  config ships `ENVIRONMENT=production`, where the bypass is inert by construction.
